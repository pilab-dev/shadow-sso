All actions of similar nature during PR validation and review will lead for immediate project contribution ban.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within the Shadow SSO project spaces, as well as any online community platforms that are not directly controlled and administered directly from project maintainers where members may engage when discussing related or complementary community projects.

## Reporting Violations

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please immediately contact the project maintainers by sending a direct email message to `gyula@pilab.hu`

All reports will be kept confidential, and a plan of action will be conducted immediately in most suitable time with due diligences to prevent future misconduct and harassment behaviours, to ensure everyone have safe project community and collaborative workspace experience with each one of our members.
