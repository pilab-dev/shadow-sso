| Dynamic Client Registration Endpoint         | Configurable (`EnabledEndpoints.Registration`, path assumed `/oauth2/register`) | Yes (`/realms/{realm-name}/clients-registrations/openid-connect`)           | Shadow SSO can enable it; Keycloak has full support.                                                                                       |

Assumed supported. | For using JWTs as authorization grants. Shadow SSO lists `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer`.                                  |
| Device Code Grant                            | Configurable (`EnabledGrantTypes.DeviceCode`)                              | Yes                                                                         | For input-constrained devices.

| **4. Key OIDC Features**                     |                                                                            |                                                                             |                                                                                                                                            |
| PKCE Support                                 | Configurable (`PKCEConfig.Enabled`, `SupportedMethods`, `AllowPlainChallengeMethod`) | Yes (enforced for FAPI, recommended generally)                            | Both support PKCE. Shadow SSO has detailed configurability. Keycloak emphasizes its use, especially with FAPI and OAuth 2.1 profiles.        |
| Token Exchange                               | Not explicitly mentioned in `OpenIDProviderConfig` structure.              | Not explicitly mentioned in the viewed doc, but Keycloak is known for extensive features. Might be supported. | RFC 8693. Not evident in Shadow SSO config from report.                                                                                    |
| Pushed Authorization Requests (PAR)          | Not explicitly mentioned in `OpenIDProviderConfig` structure.              | Yes (recommended with FAPI profiles)                                        | Keycloak supports PAR. Not evident in Shadow SSO config.                                                                                   |
| JWT Secured Authorization Response (JAR) / Request Object Support | `SecurityConfig.RequireSignedRequestObject` implies support for request objects. `AllowedSigningAlgs` for algorithms. | Yes (e.g. "encrypted OIDC request objects" for Open Finance Brasil FAPI) | Shadow SSO config suggests request object support. Keycloak supports signed/encrypted request objects, especially for FAPI.                  |
| FAPI Support / Security Profiles             | No explicit "FAPI profiles". Configurable security settings (PKCE, signing algs) align with some FAPI needs. | Yes (explicit FAPI 1/2, FAPI CIBA, Open Finance Brasil, Australia CDR profiles via Client Policies) | Keycloak has explicit, pre-defined FAPI profiles and strong FAPI compliance features. Shadow SSO provides building blocks but not named profiles. |
| Configurability of Features                  | High (most features toggled via booleans or lists in `OpenIDProviderConfig`) | High (extensive admin console and realm settings, Client Policies for fine-grained control) | Both are highly configurable, but Keycloak offers a very mature admin UI and specific profiles for complex standards like FAPI.          |

**Disclaimer:** This comparison is based on the generated report for Shadow SSO (derived from its Go configuration structure) and the specific Keycloak documentation page viewed. Some features might exist in either platform but may not have been highlighted in these specific source documents. Keycloak, being a more mature and widely deployed product, generally has a very extensive feature set beyond what's covered in a single documentation page. Shadow SSO's report reflects its *potential* capabilities based on its design.
