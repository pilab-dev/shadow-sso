// Standard Roles
const (
	RoleAdmin = "ROLE_ADMIN"
	RoleUser  = "ROLE_USER"
	// Add other core roles here if any
)

// Note: Permission constants could also be defined here or in a separate domain/permissions.go
// if they need to be referenced by packages outside of 'internal'.
// For now, only role constants are moved as per the subtask.
